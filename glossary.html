<!-- the below terms have been taken from https://www.circlesstudio.com/blog/25-web-design-development-terms-every-marketer-know/ and http://www.mediaheroesbrisbane.com.au/insights/glossary-of-web-design-development-terminology/ -->
            <div class="definition">
                <p class="definition-name">DOMAIN NAME</p>
                <p>Put simply, a domain name is the address of your website on the Internet (google.com). Domain names are essential for any website, and come in a huge range of extensions specific to your country.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition">
                <p class="definition-name">URL</p>
                <p>Standing for Uniform Resource Location, a URL is the global address of a web page and looks like this: http://www.domainname.com/. A URL will include your domain name after http://www. You will find the URL (or web address) in the address bar at the top of your browser.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition">
                <p class="definition-name">WEB HOSTING</p>
                <p>Think of web hosting as a ‘parking space for your website on the Internet. Depending on your website requirements, web hosting will vary from customer to customer but all in all – it’s the same thing. Domain name + web hosting go hand in hand and you can’t have a website without these 2 love birds.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition">
                <p class="definition-name">CACHE</p>
                <p>Remember how browsers save a copy of previously viewed sites? Well, the computer stores them in a folder called the ‘cache’ . Not to be confused with cash – or we would all have pockets full.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition">
                <p class="definition-name">REFRESH</p>
                <p>Been told to ‘refresh the page’ before? If not then you must be all over this one like white on rice. Go you. Browsers are designed to download previously viewed webpages and save them on your computer. This means when you view a page for the second time, it loads quicker. The problem with this though is; you may find that what you are seeing isn’t the most recent update of the site. If in doubt hit refresh!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition">
                <p class="definition-name">NAVIGATION</p>
                <p>Your designer may have asked you this before: “Is there any other pages you would like in your navigation” – what they’re referring to is your website’s menu! The most common place for your navigation is at the top of the page. It allows for your users to access any page in your site from 1 central location. Also referred to as: Nav, Menu, Main Menu.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition">
                <p class="definition-name">HEADER</p>
                <p>Yup. You guessed it, the header is the very top of your website & contains all the important things like: Navigation, Contact numbers, Company slogan, Social media links, Shopping cart & Items. Anything else your designer feels is super important.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition">
                <p class="definition-name">FOOTER</p>
                <p>Much like the ‘header’, the footer is placed at the foot or bottom of your site and contains much of the same information with the addition of: License numbers, ABN numbers, Accreditations, Copyright declaration, Terms & Conditions, Any other links or relevant information. The footer is great for a long scrolling website as users can easily get around the site using the nav at the bottom saving them from scrolling back to the top.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition">
                <p class="definition-name">CAPTCHA</p>
                <p>True to its name, a ‘captcha’ catches all the baddies coming through to your email inbox from your website form! By having a code that requires user input, it is an effective method to stop spam bots sending you ‘fake’ enquiries. We recommend that all website forms have a captcha.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition">
                <p class="definition-name">SITEMAP</p>

            <div class="definition">
                <p class="definition-name">404</p>
                <p>Ever stumbled across this before? A ‘404 Error’ basically means that the page you have tried to view can’t be found on the site. Reasons could be that the link is wrong or the page has been recently removed.</p>
            </div>

                <p>Another popular image format for the web. .GIFs are commonly used for images that have a very limited and solid colour pallet. Because of the small file type – depending on the image, your designer may opt to use .GIF over a .JPG.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition">
                <p class="definition-name">HTML</p>

            </div>

                <p class="definition-name">CROSS BROWSER TESTING</p>
                <p>Ask any designer about cross browser testing, and watch them squirm. When any website is built, it must be tested across multiple browsers (IE, Mozilla, Chrome, Safari) to ensure people viewing it on those browsers can view the site at its best. Cross Browser testing is an absolute MUST for any website and is a skill most valued in Brisbane web designers.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition">

                <p>W3C simply stands for The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Having a website that is W3C Compliant means that the written code has passed the standards set out by the W3C group – It is correct, compliant, and of standard!</p>
